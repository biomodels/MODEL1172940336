**Abstract:**   
Circulatory autregulation is the phenomenon whereby an isolated organ can
maintain a constant or almost-constant blood flow rate over a range of
perfusion pressures. A mathematical model is developed, based on work reported
in the physiological literature, and tuned to show that autoregulation can be
accomplished by pressure-induced oscillations in arteriolar radius. Various
features known lo be exhibited by skeletal muscle and by stretch receptors are
incorporated in the model of smooth muscle surrounding the arterioles.
